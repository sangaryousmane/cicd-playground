> Know how to work with branches

## Feature branches:
1. A feature branch is a copy of the main codebase where an individual or team of software developers can work on a new feature until it is complete.
2. Create a new feature branch from the main branch git checkout -b feature

## Release branches:
A release branch in Git is a branch specifically created to prepare and stabilize a software release. 
This branch is used to isolate the work related to finalizing and testing the code for a new version 
before it is deployed to production.
